_Some of the questions and prompts used in this project were generated with the assistance of ChatGPT, an AI language model. While these questions provide a structured approach for analysis, all interpretations, insights, and conclusions drawn from the data are my own. The use of AI was limited to brainstorming and organizing ideas for exploration._
